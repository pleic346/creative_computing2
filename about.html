<p>I am Carmen Pleitez, I am going into Communication Design with a minor in Fashion Communication. I want to study graphic design and advertising, yet, always staying within the fashion industry. In addition, I am also interested in shoe and accessory design. </p>

<p>Throughout the year I worked with various mediums and multiple platforms such as the Adobe Creative Cloud programs. I learned many skills and techniques for creating art digitally. In addition, throughout the year I discussed, studied, and researched current art, as well as, ancient art. Specifically, how art and design throughout the years have influenced us today. In many of my classes, I was able to connect whatever work we were creating (either a movie, music video, poster, painting, etc) with ongoing issues that we face in the world today. Equality was a huge topic that was talked about throughout many of my classes.</p>

<p>Two of the classes I enjoyed deeply were Drawing and Time. I was happy that I was able to practice my life drawing skills, and also illustrate using Photoshop and Illustrator. In addition, I felt time class was also a very informative class; here, I learned how to use programs such as Premier, Media Encoder, Photoshop for animation, and also how to utilize a professional camera and audio equipment. I felt this class wasn’t that necessary due to my major, but it’s definitely the class I learned the most from, and I would take it again if I had the chance. </p>

<p>During the second semester, my studio class challenged me in every way. I had to create an entire magazine; which meant creating my own editorials, articles, and advertisements. This definitely was a huge learning opportunity for me since it’s what I want to study, and hopefully, one day, get to do as a career. I learned so much; it was a challenging project for first year students, definitely stressful and time consuming, however, the hard work paid off. At the end it was an incredible feeling to have a physical printed copy of your talent, creativity, and hard work. In addition, one of my favorite assignments we had for Seminar was the writing of the short fiction. We had to choose one of our lottery topics and write either a nonfiction or fiction about that. I chose my topic of Tom Ford’s Gucci Advertising, which portrayed sexists ads and the objectification of women. I challenged myself creatively by writing a short fiction on these topics. It is a utopian short story portraying a ‘perfect woman’ who was created by science to be fit society’s standards of beauty. My strong suit has always been painting, so having a class where I could express myself through writing, was out of my comfort zone and was a surprisingly positive outcome and learning experience. </p>

<p>I feel that out of the first year, I learned many necessary skills, and perfected others I had. Everything I learned, even though it has nothing to do with my major, will help me in some way or another in the future. I am excited for the next school year where I’ll be able to go more into my actual career. Furthermore, I have also been learning outside of class, from internships I have worked at. I am excited to continue meeting people, creating fun projects, and growing as an artist. </p>
